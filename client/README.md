### Progress Report

#### Tasks Completed This Week

**Section 5: Redux Integration and JWT Authentication**

1. **Implement Redux for State Management**
   - Integrated Redux to manage the state of the sign-in process. This includes handling actions like `SignInStart`, `SignInSuccess`, and `SignInFailure`, which control the login flow's loading, success, and error states. This setup ensures that the sign-in page reacts appropriately to user actions and backend responses.

2. **Sign-In API with JWT Authentication**
   - Developed the sign-in API, which verifies user credentials and, upon successful authentication, generates a JWT. This JWT contains the user's unique database ID and is signed with a secret key (`JWT_SECRET`). The token is sent back to the client and used for maintaining authenticated sessions, allowing secure access to protected routes within the application. 

#### Tasks Planned for Next Week

1. **Implement Google OAuth Login**
   - Plan to implement Google OAuth as an additional login method, allowing users to authenticate using their Google accounts.

2. **Add Dark Mode to the Website**
   - Plan to introduce a dark mode feature, providing users with an alternative, visually comfortable theme for the website.
